PostgreSQL for WordPress is a special 'plugin' enabling WordPress to be used with a PostgreSQL database.

== Description ==

PostgreSQL for WordPress (PG4WP) gives you the possibility to install and use WordPress with a PostgreSQL database as a backend.
It works by replacing calls to MySQL specific functions with generic calls that maps them to another database functions and rewriting SQL queries on the fly when needed.

Currently, support is focused on PostgreSQL, but other databases can be added quite easily by providing the appropriate 'driver'.
MySQL driver is enclosed, which just does "nothing".
If you need/wish support for another database, please feel free to contact the author, writing a driver is not really hard if you know a bit about SQL and the database you want support for.

If you want to use this plugin, you should be aware of the following :
- WordPress with PG4WP is expected to be slower than the original WordPress with MySQL because PG4WP does much SQL rewriting for any page view
- Some WordPress plugins should work 'out of the box' but many plugins won't because they would need specific code in PG4WP

You shouldn't expect any plugin specific code to be integrated into PG4WP except for plugins shipped with WordPress itself (such as Akismet).
PG4WP 2.0 will have a mechanism to add plugin support.

== Installation ==

You have to install PG4WP *before* configuring your WordPress installation for things to work properly. 
This is because the database needs to be up and running before any plugin can be loaded.

1.  Place your WordPress files in the right place on your web server.

1.	Unzip the files from PG4WP and put the `pg4wp` directory in your `/wp-content` directory.

1.	Copy the `db.php` from the `pg4wp` directory to `wp-content`
	
	You can modify this file to configure the database driver you wish to use
	Currently you can set 'DB_DRIVER' to 'pgsql' or 'mysql'
	
	You can also activate DEBUG and/or ERROR logs

1.	Create `wp-config.php` from `wp-config-sample.php` if it does not already exist (PG4WP does not currently intercept database connection setup).

1.	Point your Web Browser to your WordPress installation and go through the traditional WordPress installation routine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have an error adding a new category =

You should try to run `SELECT setval('wp_terms_seq', (SELECT MAX(term_id) FROM wp_terms)+1);` to correct the sequence number for the `wp_terms` table.

Note : you should replace wp_ with the appropriate table prefix if you changed it in your WordPress installation

= Does plugin `put any plugin name here` work with PG4WP ? =

There is no simple answer to this question.
Plugins not doing any database calls will certainly work.

Database-intensive plugins may work, but most of them would require specific code in PG4WP to work.

You should backup your setup (at least database) and try to install the plugin to see if it works or not.
Whether it worked or not, you should tell me the result of your test, so that I can create some kind of listing of working/not working plugins.
